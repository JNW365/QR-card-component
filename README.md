## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS
- Flexbox


### What I learned

How to read a Figma file.

### Continued development

I definitely need to do more of these challenges as well as get more practices coding from an established
design. Learning Figma would be very beneficial.
